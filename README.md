# Loan Performance Analysis Project - Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the creation of an interactive **Loan Performance Dashboard** in Power BI. The dashboard provides insights into loan performance across various metrics, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

## Objectives
- **Analyze Loan Performance**: Understand distribution, defaults, and repayment trends.
- **Identify Key Metrics**: Highlight critical KPIs such as total loan amount, default rate, and average tenure.
- **Enhance Decision-Making**: Provide actionable insights to optimize loan products and improve operational efficiency.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Synthetic dataset representing over 10,000 loan records.
- **Key Attributes**:
  - Loan Details: Loan ID, Product Type, Amount, Start and End Dates.
  - Customer Details: Location, Age, Credit Score.
  - Loan Metrics: Loan Status, Interest Rate, Tenure, Late Payments.

## Key Metrics & Visualizations
1. **Total Loan Amount**: Sum of all loan amounts.
2. **Default Rate**: Percentage of loans in default.
3. **Loan Distribution**: Analysis by product type and region.
4. **Repayment Trends**: Proportions of fully repaid, ongoing, and defaulted loans.

## Power BI Workflow
1. **Data Import**: Loaded the dataset from an Excel file.
2. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Removed null values and duplicates.
   - Ensured correct data types for columns.
3. **Data Transformation**:
   - Added calculated columns: Loan Tenure and Monthly EMI.
4. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Created bar charts, KPI indicators, maps, and pie charts for analysis.

## Visualizations
- **KPI Indicators**: Show total loans, average tenure, and default rate.
- **Loan Distribution by Product Type**: Bar chart showing loan amounts across products.
- **Default Rate by Region**: Stacked bar chart for regional comparison.
- **Loan Performance by Region**: Visualization for regional trends.
- **Repayment Trends**: Pie chart showing repayment status proportions.

## Insights
- **Default Rates**:
  - Higher defaults in certain regions and products.
  - Correlation between low credit scores and defaults.
- **Loan Distribution**:
  - Significant concentration in specific products/regions.
- **Repayment Trends**:
  - Major proportion of loans are either actively repaid or defaulted.

## Recommendations
- **Customer Segmentation**: Focus on high-risk customers with tailored repayment plans.
- **Product Optimization**: Tighten eligibility criteria for high-default products.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Automate monitoring for high-risk loans using dashboards.
